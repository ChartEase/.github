# ChartEase
We have developed a web-application that streamlines the charting process for nurses by automating the entry of repetitive information and integrating health data analytics functionalities. The application will aim to reduce the time spent on charting tasks while providing valuable insights from patient data to support clinical decision-making.

### Problem Statement
Nurses spend a significant amount of time filling out repetitive information in patient charts, which could be better utilized in patient care activities. This issue not only impacts the efficiency of nursing staff but also leaves room for errors due to manual data entry. Additionally, there's potential to leverage health data analytics to derive insights from patient data, leading to better patient care outcomes.
