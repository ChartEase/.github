We have developed a web application that enables nurses to allocate more resources toward patient care rather than administrative work. Patients will receive a higher-quality experience while reducing the burnout experienced by nurses. To accomplish this, we streamlined the charting process for nurses by introducing intelligent speech-to-text technology to speed up the charting process and implemented data analytics to provide immediate diagnosis recommendations.

### Problem Statement
Nurses spend a significant amount of time filling out repetitive information in patient charts, which could be better utilized in patient care activities. This issue not only impacts the efficiency of nursing staff but also results in poor experiences for patients of the hospital. There is potential to leverage health data analytics to derive insights from patient data, leading to better patient care outcomes.
