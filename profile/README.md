# Kair
We have developed a web application that enables nurses to allocate more resources toward patient care rather than administrative work. Patients will receive a higher-quality experience while reducing the burnout experienced by nurses. To accomplish this, we streamlined the charting process for nurses by introducing intelligent speech-to-text technology to speed up the charting process and implemented data analytics to provide immediate diagnosis recommendations.

### Our Inspiration
We interviewed several nurses during the hackathon over the phone to determine what their pain points are. Burn-out is a major concern in the world of nursing, which was reaffirmed by our interviewees. The burn-out nurses feel directly impacts the quality of care patients receive in the hospital. 

### Problem Statement
33,679,935 patients visited hospitals in the United States in 2023. According to the National Library of Medicine (NIH), almost 40% of respondents had a poor experience at their most recent hospital visit. Nurses spend a significant amount of time filling out repetitive information in patient charts, which could be better utilized in patient care activities. This issue not only impacts the efficiency of nursing staff but also results in poor experiences for patients of the hospital. There is potential to leverage health data analytics to derive insights from patient data, leading to better patient care outcomes.

### Technologies We Used

### Challenges We Faced
We originally went with the name ChartEase, but after speaking to mentors we concluded that our product name did not properly recognize the value we are providing to patients receiving care from nurses. Kair recognizes the positive effects our platform has for both nurses and patients.
